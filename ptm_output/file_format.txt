ptm_????.dat
============
The ptm files contain particle trajectories.
Each particle has its time history printed in a block. The block is prefixed by
a hash '#' and then the number of the particle in the simulation. If the run
traced multiple particles, these will all be in the same ptm file. The order of
writing the particles will not necessarily correspond to the numeric ordering
of particles being simulated.

Each file will have 8 columns and an unknown number of rows. The columns are:
TIME XPOS YPOS ZPOS VPERP VPARA ENERGY PITCHANGLE

In each line the values correspond to the time given in the first column.


map_????.dat
============
The map files are output in fluxmap mode. Each line represents a different
particle with a unique energy, pitch angle, and phase angle. Time history is
not given in this mode. Initial and final quantities required for flux mapping
are included in this file. As with the ptm files, the particles are not
necessarily written in numeric order.

Each file will have a header line that gives the initial position for the
particles being traced.

Each file will have 10 columns and the number of rows will correspond to the
number of particles in that run. The columns are:
TIME XPOS YPOS ZPOS IENERGY PITCHANGLE FENERGY VX VY VZ

In each line the position (XPOS, YPOS, ZPOS) is the final position of the
traced particle. IENERGY and PITCHANGLE are the initial energy and pitch angle
of the particle. FENERGY is the final energy of the particle. The initial
velocity of the particle in Cartesian coordinates is given by (VX, VY, VZ).
