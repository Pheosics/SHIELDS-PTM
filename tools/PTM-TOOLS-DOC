# PTM-Tools

## Alternate way of Preparing PTM input files (using LANLGeoMag instead of SWMF  files)

### ptm_lanlgeomag.c

To compile and run on scheme, do
```
> module2 load lanlgeomag perl gsl
> make
> ./ptm_lanlgeomag
```

Selecting the date/time, and model for desired B-field, can bedone via the command-line
parser.
	
Output is created in creates in directory ptm_T89_data/
- the model is evaluated on a uniform (spatial grid currently set in code in ptm_lanlgeomag.c)
- the magnetic field, electric field and grid are all in one file
- the electric field is set to zero as the field model is magnetic field only, and 

Once 'ptm_T89_data' is created, push up to grizzly where PTM can be run
`> scp -r ptm_T89_data user@wtrw:gr-fe:~/PTM/scripts/`
