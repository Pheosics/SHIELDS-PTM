PTM-Tools

A. Alternate way of Preparing PTM input files (using LANLGeoMag instead of SWFM .mhd files)

	PTM_LANLGEOMAG.c
	1. to set the date and model for desired B-field, edit ptm_lanlgeomag.c 
	
	to compile and run on scheme, do 
	> module2 load lanlgeomag perl gsl
	> make
	> ./ptm_lanlgeomag

	2. creates in directory ptm_T89_data/
		a. a uniform "x/y/zgrid.txt" for E&B (choose spatial grid on lines 117-124 in ptm_lanlgeomag.c)
		b. the magnetic field files "b(x,y,z)3d_000.txt"
		c. the electric field files "e(x,y,z)3d_000.txt", which are all 0

	IMPORTANT: The B/E data_output files do not contain the XYZ grid. You must use XYZ and B/E files that were both created with same run of ./ptm_lanlgeomag

	Once 'ptm_T89_data' is created, push up to grizzly where PTM can be run
	> scp -r ptm_T89_data user@wtrw:gr-fe:~/PTM/scripts/

	PTM_LANLGEOMAG_INTERP.py
	1. reads in the .txt files from ptm_T89_data/ and translates them into comparabale data products (.bin) produced by ptm_tec_interp.py.  Once created, move into ptm_data and follow PTM_DOC to create ptm_input
