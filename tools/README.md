# PTM-Tools

This directory contains tools to complement the functionality of PTM.
`ptm_lanlgeomag` can be used to generate fields data for PTM with any of
the empirical/semi-empirical field models in LANLGeoMag instead of using
SWMF output data in concert with the Python pre-processing.

To use, simply compile using `make`, then run

```
./ptm_lanlgeomag --help
```

to see the required arguments and options.
